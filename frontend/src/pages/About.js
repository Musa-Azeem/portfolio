      <p>
        I am a junior at the University of South Carolina studying computer engineering. I have a strong interest in technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems, especially in fields of medicine. As an undergraduate research assistant in the Valafar Group, I am working with a team on Android Wear OS development and the applications of machine learning in human activity recognition. After graduation, I plan to complete an accelerated masterâ€™s degree in computer science before transitioning to the data science or application development industry.
